                        AI Agents Are Becoming Game Dev Sidekicks
                    </h2>
                    <p>AI agents — not just assistants, but autonomous systems — are now helping developers write code, debug, and even design levels. OpenAI’s latest agent can browse the web, analyze data, and make decisions like a junior dev. Microsoft and Google are also rolling out tools that let AI collaborate with humans on game logic and storytelling. It’s not just about speeding up development — it’s about unlocking creativity by offloading the grunt work.</p>

                    <p>For developers who live in the command line, Google’s new Gemini CLI tool lets you interact with AI directly from your terminal. You can ask it to generate code, debug, or even summarize documentation—without ever leaving your dev environment. It’s like having a coding buddy who speaks bash and Python fluently. This tool is part of Google’s push to make AI native to developer workflows, not just a fancy add-on</p>
