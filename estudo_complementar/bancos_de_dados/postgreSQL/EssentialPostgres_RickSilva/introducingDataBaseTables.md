# Essential Postgres - DataBase Development using PostgreSQL - RickSilva

## Introducing database tables

In Postgres, data is stored in database tables. A table is a structured collection of data organized into rows and columns. Each table represents a specific type of entity or object, and each row corresponds to a single record of that entity.




The autor used a table called us_president that has been defined with three columns: president_id, president_name and president_party. On my study examples, I created my own version of this table with the columns: id, name, term_start, term_end and party.


![insert table's picture here]()

In both tables contains 46 rows of data, one for each president.

### Name database tables
When naming database tables, it's a good idea to stick with singular names like us_president rather than plural names like us_presidents.
