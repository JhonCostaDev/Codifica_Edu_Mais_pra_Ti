# 4.19_SalesCommissionCalculator

## English
(SalesCommission Calculator) A large company pays its salespeople on a commission basis.
 The salespeople receive $200 per week plus 9% of their gross sales for that week. For example, a salesperson who sells $5000 worth of merchandise in a week receives $200 plus 9% of $5000, or a total of $650. You’ve been supplied with a list of the items sold by each salesperson. The values of these items are as follows:
 
 Item Value
 1    239.99
 2    129.75
 3    99.95
 4    350.89
 
 Develop a Java application that inputs one salesperson’s items sold for last week and calculates and
 displays that salesperson’s earnings. There’s no limit to the number of items that can be sold.
